# Movie-Data-Scraping-Macro
This VBA (Excel Macro) code takes a Wikipedia article for a movie and outputs the data in the article into the appropriate columns of an Excel file. Many data points are scraped, such as release date, cast and crew's names, and financials of the movie. Cast and crew's names are outputted as a comma separated list.
